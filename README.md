This code appears to be an implementation of a verifier for checking the balance of angle brackets in a file. It uses a stack to keep track of the brackets and checks whether the stack is empty at the end to ensure that all brackets are balanced.

The code consists of two classes, Verifier and arrayStack. Verifier class is responsible for reading the input file and verifying the balance of the angle brackets in it, while arrayStack class is an implementation of a stack data structure using an array.
